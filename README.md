A simple Web Crawler

This repository contains two Web Crawlers.

1. Web Crawler in Java - I've used External Library **jsoup** to make HTTP request and to parse the page. By making appropiate changes to the code, it can be used to search anything on the Internet. Inorder to use it, simply run the SpiderTest.java file.

2. Web Crawler in JavaScript - I've used **cheerio** to parse the page. By making appropiate changes to the code, it can be used to search anything on the Internet. Inorder to use it, simply type the following line in the Node.js Command Prompt.

```
node crawler.js
```

**What is Web Crawler?**

A Web crawler is an Internet bot which systematically browses the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing (web spidering).

Web search engines and some other sites use Web crawling or spidering software to update their web content or indices of others sites' web content. 
Web crawlers can copy all the pages they visit for later processing by a search engine which indexes the downloaded pages so the users can search much more efficiently.
