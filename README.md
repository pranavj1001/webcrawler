A simple Web Crawler

This repository contains a Web Crawler. The Crawler's code is written in Java Language.

**Update** - A new webcrawler using JS is in the works.

I've used External Library **jsoup** to make HTTP request and to parse the page.

**What is Web Crawler?**

A Web crawler is an Internet bot which systematically browses the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing (web spidering).

Web search engines and some other sites use Web crawling or spidering software to update their web content or indices of others sites' web content. 
Web crawlers can copy all the pages they visit for later processing by a search engine which indexes the downloaded pages so the users can search much more efficiently.
